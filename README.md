Learn to code
=============

Complete course of web development. For people without any development
experience.

This curse covers:

* frontend: HTML, CSS, bootstrap, Javascript, React, Redux.
* backend: Ruby (Ruby on Rails, Sinatra)
* database: SQL (Postgresql, sqlite), dictionary database (Redis)
* platform: Linux
* dev tools: Linux (as a workstation), vcs (git), code editor (atom), graphics
  (gimp, Inkscape), collaboration tool (gitlab)

You need Linux operating system. Mac OS X is fine, but you have to cover
differences by your self.

Why not Windows? Linux is fare more suitable for the job.

> If you are a **[Vendor Lock-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vendor_lock-in)**
  victim and you have to stay on Windows you can use virtual machine or work on
  remote Linux machine like Virtual Private Server (VPS).

If you are unfamiliar with Linux read [Linux intro](lessons/linux.md) (*ToDo*)
first.

This curse is maintained in git repository. To begin clone this repository and
checkout first lesson.

There is "git intro" on the first lesson, if you don't know anything about git

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/mariusz-kowalski/learn_to_code.git
cd learn_to_code
git checkout 000_html_intro
