Learn to Code
=============

Plan of whole process
---------------------

Main thread:

1. Data structure
2. Business Logic
3. Presentation

Know your tools:

* Editor - Atom or other if you have any preferences
* Linux (or OS X)
  * installing the system
  * console
  * file structure
  * discs and filesystems
  * installing software
  * network
  * containers :)
* Git

Data structure
--------------

### Learn: SQL

* [ ] select
* [ ] insert
* [ ] update
* [ ] delete
* [ ] import/export CSV data
* [ ] join
* [ ] create table
* [ ] indexes
* [ ] alter table

### Practice: design and create database.

Make your own application. Think of one that you want to create, it may be
useful for you. It should organize some data collections. It may be:
* your music collection manager
* football manager (a game)
* other....

This application should manage data complex enough, data that changes over time.
There should be records of data own by users...

### Practice: introduce migrations.

> We need some tool, that will cover Business Logic and Presentation Layer
