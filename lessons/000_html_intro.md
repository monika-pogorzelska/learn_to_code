New tool: git
-------------

Git is a version control system. It tracks your changes while you write your
code. You make changes and then you commits it into repository. Commits are
checkpoints in time of your code (or any text). You can go back to any of your
previous commits. You can push commits from your repository to other (remote
most often). You can pull commits from other (remote) repositories to yours.
It's excellent for team work. Git prevents from overriding someone else changes,
when two of team members worked on same part of code.

There are many graphical user interface (GUI) tools for git, but I recommend
you to use command line interface (CLI). Every examples here are console
commands.

This course is maintained in git repository.
